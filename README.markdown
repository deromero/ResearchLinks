#Research Links

##Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple web application that will allow the user to create projects to research topics of interest and for each project create research items that each include notes, links, images, and tags related to the item of interest.  For example there could be a project called "AngularJS" that includes multiple research items about "Controllers", "Resources", "Services", etc.  This would allow a centralized storage for a developer to refer to later as they learn more about a new technology.

##Technology

This project is also a deep-dive into the best practices of building an ASP.Net Web API as a backend REST web service and AngularJS as the front end web single-page web application (SPA).  It includes authentication and unit testing of the back-end service which are topics often left out of the demos and documentation on the ASP.Net Web API. It is also meant to study how well ASP.Net Web API is suited to making RESTful API's that are easy to consume by the end developer.
